#CodeIgniter Test_Controller Library

Provides JUnit-style unit testing for Modular CodeIgniter (Modular Extensions).
It's not supposed to be working within vanilla CodeIgniter setups. The library is
included in the preconfigured [CodeIgniter Maestro](https://github.com/sepehr/ci-maestro) starter kit.

This is a complete rewrite of TOAST library by Jens Roland to make it:
* Compatible with CodeIgniter 2+ releases
* Compatible with Modular CodeIgniter (Modular Extensions)
* More simplistic on design and usage

##Requirements
* PHP cURL Extension
* CodeIgniter Modular Extensions

##Installation
* Place `Test_Controller.php` in `application/libraries` directory.
* Add library routing rule to `application/config/routes.php`:
`$route['([a-z0-9_]*)/tests'] = '$1/tests/Test_$1/index';`
* Create `application/modules/[MODULE_NAME]/controllers/tests` directory
* Create `application/modules/[MODULE_NAME]/controllers/tests/Test_[MODULE_NAME].php`
* All module test case results should be available at `http://example.com/[MODULE_NAME]/tests`
* See the section below for the usage instructions.

##Usage
```php
require APPPATH . '/libraries/Test_controller.php';
class Test_welcome extends Test_Controller {
	public function __construct()
	{
		parent::__construct(__FILE__);
		// Load models, controllers, libraries, etc to test.
	}

	public function test_assert_var_true() {
		$var = TRUE;
		$this->_assert_true($var);
	}
}
/* End of file application/modules/welcome/controllers/tests/test_welcome.php */
```
* Your test controller should extend `Test_Controller` abstract class.
* Your test controller class must call Test_Controller's constructor passing `__FILE__` to it.
* It's recommended to name your test classes follow this naming pattern: `Test_[MODULE_NAME][_SUFFIX]`
   example: `Test_welcome[_user] extends Test_Controler`
* You can write several test classes per module, `Test_[MODULE_NAME].php` is required
   if you want a test index page located at `http://example.com/[MODULE_NAME]/tests` page.
* Your test functions must have a `test_` prefix to be considered as a test case by the library.
* Do not override the `index()` function in your test class, unless you know what you're doing.
* **Consider that this library is in early development stage, please use issue tracker to report your huntings!**

##TODO
* Methods should be properly renamed, reordered, etc. it's already a mess!
* `_theme_results()` function should be rewritten to be more flexible and clean.
* Class configurables should be exposed in a CodeIgniter config file.
* Add type assertion helpers.
